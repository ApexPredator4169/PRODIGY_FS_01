# Secure Authentication Demonstration

- This portal was created to demonstrate secure authentication based on user roles.
- 2 roles are used here : User and Admin
- When logged in as a user, you cannot access the admin dashboard (even though the option is shown)
- It uses React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB
- Password hashing is done using bcrypt, JWT tokens are used for session management
